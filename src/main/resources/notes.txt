In the case of an SEI the methods defined are intended to be mapped to operations exposed by a service.
The SEI corresponds to a wsdl:portType element. The methods defined by the SEI correspond to wsdl:operation elements in the wsdl:portType element.

JAX-WS relies on the annotation feature of Java 5.
The JAX-WS annotations are used to specify the metadata used to map the SEI to a fully specified service definition.
Among the information provided in the annotations are the following:

- The target namespace for the service.
- The name of the class used to hold the request message.
- The name of the class used to hold the response message.
- If an operation is a one way operation.
- The binding style the service uses.
- The name of the class used for any custom exceptions.
- The namespaces under which the types used by the service are defined.

The @WebMethod annotation is defined by the javax.jws.WebMethod interface.
It is placed on the methods in the SEI. The @WebMethod annotation provides the information that is normally represented
in the wsdl:operation element describing the operation to which the method is associated.

for exception:
The @WebFault annotation is defined by the javax.xml.ws.WebFault interface.
It is placed on exceptions that are thrown by your SEI. The @WebFault annotation is used to map the Java exception to a wsdl:fault element.
This information is used to marshall the exceptions into a representation that can be processed by both the service and its consumers
